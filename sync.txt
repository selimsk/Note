I'll help you copy files from a remote computer to your local machine using `rsync` over SSH with detailed logging.

## Basic rsync Command with Progress and Logging

Here's the recommended command:

```bash
rsync -avzhP --stats user@remote-host:/remote/path/ /local/path/ 2>&1 | tee rsync_log.txt
```

## Breaking Down the Options

- **`-a`** (archive): Preserves permissions, timestamps, symbolic links, etc.
- **`-v`** (verbose): Shows detailed output of what's being transferred
- **`-z`** (compress): Compresses data during transfer
- **`-h`** (human-readable): Shows file sizes in KB, MB, GB
- **`-P`**: Combination of `--progress` (shows progress bar) and `--partial` (keeps partial files if interrupted)
- **`--stats`**: Shows detailed transfer statistics at the end
- **`2>&1 | tee rsync_log.txt`**: Displays output on screen AND saves to a log file

## More Advanced Options

For even more detailed logging:

```bash
rsync -avzhP --stats --itemize-changes user@remote-host:/remote/path/ /local/path/ 2>&1 | tee rsync_log_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt
```

Additional useful options:
- **`--itemize-changes`**: Shows exactly what changed for each file
- **`--dry-run`** or **`-n`**: Test run without actually copying (highly recommended first!)
- **`--exclude='pattern'`**: Exclude certain files/folders
- **`--delete`**: Delete files in destination that don't exist in source (use carefully!)

## Example Workflow

1. **First, do a dry run:**
```bash
rsync -avzhP --stats --dry-run user@remote-host:/remote/path/ /local/path/
```

2. **If everything looks good, run the actual sync:**
```bash
rsync -avzhP --stats user@remote-host:/remote/path/ /local/path/ 2>&1 | tee rsync_log.txt
```

3. **View the log later:**
```bash
less rsync_log.txt
```

## Important Notes

- **Trailing slashes matter!** 
  - `/remote/path/` copies the *contents* of the folder
  - `/remote/path` copies the folder itself
- The command is resumable - if interrupted, run it again and it will continue
- Use `--dry-run` first to verify what will be copied!
