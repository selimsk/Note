I'll show you the Linux terminal commands to change permissions on a pen drive for all users.

## Step-by-Step Commands

**1. First, identify your pen drive:**
```bash
lsblk
# or
sudo fdisk -l
```
Look for your pen drive (usually `/dev/sdb1`, `/dev/sdc1`, etc.)

**2. Check where it's mounted:**
```bash
df -h
# or
mount | grep /dev/sdb1
```
It's usually mounted at `/media/yourusername/drivename` or `/mnt`

**3. Change permissions on the mounted drive:**

```bash
# Give full read/write permissions to everyone
sudo chmod 777 /media/yourusername/drivename

# Or use this for files and folders
sudo chmod -R 777 /media/yourusername/drivename
```

**4. If you need to mount it manually with full permissions:**

```bash
# Unmount first if already mounted
sudo umount /dev/sdb1

# Create mount point
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/pendrive

# Mount with full permissions (for FAT32/exFAT)
sudo mount -o umask=0000 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/pendrive

# Or for NTFS
sudo mount -o permissions /dev/sdb1 /mnt/pendrive
```

**5. Change ownership (alternative method):**
```bash
sudo chown -R yourusername:users /media/yourusername/drivename
sudo chmod -R 775 /media/yourusername/drivename
```

## Quick Permission Reference
- `777` = full access for everyone (rwx for all)
- `775` = full for owner/group, read+execute for others
- `755` = full for owner, read+execute for others
